Get Started
=============================

To get started, we recommend starting with the demos. To get access to all the
demos, execute the following command in a terminal window:

.. code-block:: bash

   cbcflow-get-demos
   
To list and run all the demos, execute

.. code-block:: bash

   cd cbcflow-demos/demo
   ./cbcflow_demos.py --list
   ./cbcflow_demos.py --run
   
   
If you have downloaded the development version, it is sufficient to download the
demo data in the root folder of the repository:

.. code-block:: bash

   cbcflow-get-data
