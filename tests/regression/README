This directory contains regression tests of the headflow solver project.

These tests can run longer computations and compare with reference values,
but keep them as short as possible to cover what we need to test.
Eventually we can split the tests into short and long suites if needed.

TODO: Add reference comparison framework, maybe based on postprocessing framework?
