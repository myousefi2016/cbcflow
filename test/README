Test organization:

    unit/       - Tests of internal cbcflow components and interfaces.
    regression/ - Tests running combinations of schemes and problems and writing
                  values of error norms and other fields to a reference database.
    scripts/    - Utility scripts for working with the test suite.
    output/     - Validation tests will write output here. Should never be checked in, these are local files.

    cbcflow-reference-data/  - Vetted reference data for regression tests. If missing run ./scripts/download.py.

To run full default set of tests:

    py.test

To run unit or regression tests only:

    py.test unit
    py.test regression

Example commands for running regression tests for only selected schemes and problems:

    cd regression/
    time py.test -s --testsize fast --schemes IPCS IPCS --type changed --problems Womersley2D Beltrami
    time py.test -s --testsize debug --schemes IPCS --type changed --problems Womersley2D 
    time py.test -s --testsize all --schemes IPCS --type changed --problems Womersley2D 

To download references for comparison with regression test output:

    ./scripts/download

To upload new references after new tests have been run, use one of:

    ./scripts/upload_incremental
    ./scripts/upload_replace

The former will only add new and changed reference files, the latter
will delete reference files that are missing from output/.
Both will commit a new file with the new reference data id to cbcflow
so remember to push that one.
