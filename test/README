Test organization:

    unit/       - Tests of internal cbcflow components and interfaces.
    validation/ - Tests running combinations of schemes and problems and writing
                  values of error norms and other fields to a reference database.

To run default set of tests:

    time py.test

Example commands for running only selected schemes and problems:

    cd validation/
    time py.test -s --testsize fast --schemes IPCS IPCS_Stable --type changed --problems Womersley2D Beltrami
    time py.test -s --testsize debug --schemes IPCS_Stable --type changed --problems Womersley2D 
    time py.test -s --testsize all --schemes IPCS_Stable --type changed --problems Womersley2D 

To download references for comparison with validation test output:

    ./scripts/download

To upload new references after new tests have been run, use one of:

    ./scripts/upload_incremental
    ./scripts/upload_replace

The former will only add new and changed reference files, the latter
will delete reference files that are missing from output/.
Both will commit a new file with the new reference data id to cbcflow
so remember to push that one.
